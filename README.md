üö¶ XState StateMachine for Python
A robust, asynchronous, and feature-complete Python library for parsing and executing state machines defined in XState-compatible JSON.

This library brings the power and clarity of formal state machines and statecharts, as popularized by XState, to the Python ecosystem. It allows you to define complex application logic as a clear, traversable graph and execute it in a fully asynchronous, predictable, and debuggable way.

Define your logic once in a simple JSON format, and use this library to bring it to life in your Python application.

üß≠ Core Philosophy: Definition vs. Implementation
Definition (The "What"): You define your state machine's structure, states, and transitions in a JSON file. This is your blueprint. It describes what can happen.

Implementation (The "How"): You write the business logic‚Äîthe actual code that runs‚Äîin Python. This describes how actions are performed or services are called.

This separation makes your application logic easier to understand, test, and maintain.

üé® Design Your Logic Visually with the Stately Editor
One of the biggest advantages of using an XState-compatible format is the ability to visualize, design, and even simulate your logic using a graphical interface. The official Stately Editor allows you to drag-and-drop states, define transitions, and export the resulting JSON directly for use with this library.

‚ú® Key Features
- XState Compatible: Parses JSON configurations generated from the XState ecosystem.
- Fully Asynchronous: Built on asyncio for modern, non-blocking applications.
- Hierarchical & Parallel States: Model complex logic with nested and parallel states.
- Automatic Logic Discovery: Optionally, let the library find and bind your Python functions to your machine's logic automatically, reducing boilerplate.
- Timed Events: Use after for declarative, time-based transitions.
- Asynchronous Services: Use invoke to call async functions and react to their success (onDone) or failure (onError).
- Actor Model: Spawn child state machines from a parent machine for concurrent, isolated logic.
- Guards: Implement conditional transitions with simple guard functions.
- Developer Friendly: Full type hinting and a LoggingInspector plugin for easy debugging.

üì¶ Installation
Install the library directly from PyPI:

Bash
```bash
pip install xstate-statemachine
```

üöÄ Getting Started: A Simple Example
Let's create a simple toggle switch.

1. Define the Machine (toggle.json)
JSON
```json
{
  "id": "toggle",
  "initial": "inactive",
  "states": {
    "inactive": {
      "on": {
        "TOGGLE": "active"
      }
    },
    "active": {
      "on": {
        "TOGGLE": "inactive"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
2. Implement and Run
This machine has no custom logic (actions, guards, or services), so we can create it directly.

Python
```python
import asyncio
import json
from xstate_statemachine import create_machine, Interpreter

async def main():
    with open("toggle.json") as f:
        toggle_config = json.load(f)

    # Since there's no custom logic, we can create the machine directly.
    toggle_machine = create_machine(toggle_config)

    interpreter = await Interpreter(toggle_machine).start()
    print(f"Initial state: {interpreter.current_state_ids}")

    await interpreter.send("TOGGLE")
    await asyncio.sleep(0.01)
    print(f"New state: {interpreter.current_state_ids}")

    await interpreter.stop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

üß† Core Concepts
There are two primary ways to provide your Python implementations (actions, guards, services) to the state machine: Explicit Binding (the classic way) and Automatic Discovery (the new, convenient way).

ü§ñ Automatic Logic Discovery (Convention over Configuration)
This is the recommended approach for quickly wiring up your logic. Instead of manually creating a MachineLogic object, you can place your implementation functions in a Python module and tell the factory where to find them.

How it Works: The LogicLoader inspects your modules, finds your functions, and automatically binds them to the names in your JSON config.

Naming Convention: It's smart about names! A camelCase name in your JSON (like "myAction") will automatically match a snake_case function in your Python code (def my_action(...)).

Example
1. Your Logic (my_logic.py)

Python
```python
# No MachineLogic object needed here! Just define your functions.
def my_action(interpreter, context, event, action_def):
    print("Action executed!")
```
2. Your Runner (main.py)

Python
```python
from xstate_statemachine import create_machine

# Tell the factory where to find your logic functions.
machine = create_machine(
    config=my_config,
    logic_modules=["my_logic"] # Pass the module path as a string
)
# ... or ...
import my_logic
machine = create_machine(
    config=my_config,
    logic_modules=[my_logic] # Pass the imported module object
)
```

Actions & Context
Actions are "fire-and-forget" functions executed during transitions.

drone.json
```json
{
  "id": "drone",
  "initial": "flying",
  "context": { "battery": 100 },
  "states": {
    "flying": { "on": { "PHOTO_TAKEN": { "actions": ["decrementBattery"] } } }
  }
}
```
drone_logic.py
```python
# With Automatic Discovery, this is all you need.
def decrement_battery(interpreter, context, event, action_def):
    context["battery"] -= 1
    print(f"Battery at {context['battery']}%")
```
main.py
```python
from xstate_statemachine import create_machine, MachineLogic

# ü§ñ Option 1: Automatic Discovery (Recommended)
machine = create_machine(drone_config, logic_modules=["drone_logic"])

# üß† Option 2: Explicit Binding (Classic)
from drone_logic import decrement_battery
logic = MachineLogic(actions={"decrementBattery": decrement_battery})
machine = create_machine(drone_config, logic=logic)
```
Guards
Guards are conditions that must return True for a transition to be taken.

checkout.json
```json
{
  "id": "cart",
  "context": { "items": [] },
  "on": { "CHECKOUT": { "target": "paying", "guard": "cartIsNotEmpty" } }
}
```
checkout_logic.py
```python
# With Automatic Discovery, this is all you need.
def cart_is_not_empty(context, event):
    return len(context.get("items", [])) > 0
```
main.py
```python
from xstate_statemachine import create_machine, MachineLogic

# ü§ñ Option 1: Automatic Discovery (Recommended)
machine = create_machine(cart_config, logic_modules=["checkout_logic"])

# üß† Option 2: Explicit Binding (Classic)
from checkout_logic import cart_is_not_empty
logic = MachineLogic(guards={"cartIsNotEmpty": cart_is_not_empty})
machine = create_machine(cart_config, logic=logic)
```
Asynchronous Services (invoke)
invoke is used for long-running or async operations.

fetch.json
```json
{
  "id": "fetcher",
  "initial": "loading",
  "states": {
    "loading": {
      "invoke": {
        "src": "fetchUserData",
        "onDone": { "target": "success" },
        "onError": { "target": "failure" }
      }
    },
    "success": {}, "failure": {}
  }
}
```
fetch_logic.py
```python
import aiohttp

# With Automatic Discovery, this is all you need.
async def fetch_user_data(interpreter, context, event):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get("https://api.example.com/user") as resp:
            resp.raise_for_status()
            return await resp.json()
```
main.py
```python
from xstate_statemachine import create_machine, MachineLogic

# ü§ñ Option 1: Automatic Discovery (Recommended)
machine = create_machine(fetch_config, logic_modules=["fetch_logic"])

# üß† Option 2: Explicit Binding (Classic)
from fetch_logic import fetch_user_data
logic = MachineLogic(services={"fetchUserData": fetch_user_data})
machine = create_machine(fetch_config, logic=logic)
```
Timed Events (after)
Declaratively schedule transitions to occur after a delay (in milliseconds). No custom logic is needed for this.

traffic_light.json
```json
{
    "id": "light",
    "initial": "green",
    "states": {
        "green": { "after": { "30000": "yellow" } },
        "yellow": { "after": { "5000": "red" } }
    }
}
```
Parallel States
Model system components that operate independently at the same time. The parent onDone transition fires only when all child regions have reached their final state.

build.json
```json
{
  "id": "build",
  "type": "parallel",
  "onDone": "success",
  "states": {
    "backend": { /* ... has a final state ... */ },
    "frontend": { /* ... has a final state ... */ }
  }
}
```
Actors (Spawning Machines)
For truly isolated, concurrent logic, you can spawn a child machine from a parent. The parent and child can communicate by sending events to each other.

To spawn an actor, an entry action of the form spawn_<serviceName> is used, where <serviceName> is a key in your services logic that provides a pre-built MachineNode.

main_machine.py
```python
import asyncio
from xstate_statemachine import create_machine, MachineLogic

# 1. Define the child machine that will be spawned
child_config = { "id": "pinger", "on": { "PING": { "actions": ["pong"] } } }
child_logic = MachineLogic(
    actions={"pong": lambda i,c,e,a: asyncio.create_task(i.parent.send("PONG"))}
)
child_machine_node = create_machine(child_config, child_logic)

# 2. Define the parent machine's config and logic
parent_config = {
    "id": "parent", "initial": "running",
    "states": { "running": { "entry": ["spawn_pingerService"] } },
    "on": { "PONG": "finished" }
}
# 3. The service maps a name to the child MachineNode
parent_logic = MachineLogic(services={"pingerService": child_machine_node})

# 4. Create the parent machine
parent_machine = create_machine(parent_config, logic=parent_logic)
```
üêû Debugging with Plugins
The interpreter supports a plugin system. The built-in LoggingInspector is invaluable for seeing exactly what your machine is doing.

Python
```python
import logging
from xstate_statemachine import Interpreter, LoggingInspector

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

interpreter = Interpreter(my_machine)
interpreter.use(LoggingInspector()) # Attach the plugin

await interpreter.start()
```
