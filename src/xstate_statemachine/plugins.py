# üîå Plugin System
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This module defines the base class for plugins, which allows for extending
# the interpreter's functionality using an Observer pattern. This architecture
# provides a clean separation of concerns where cross-cutting logic like
# logging, debugging, or persistence can be added without modifying the
# core interpreter code. This makes the system highly extensible and
# maintainable.

from __future__ import annotations

# Import for type checking to avoid circular dependencies at runtime.
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Generic, Set, TypeVar

from .logger import logger

# The `if TYPE_CHECKING:` block allows us to import types for hinting
# without causing circular import errors at runtime.

# üîπ Type Variable for Generic Plugin
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This TypeVar is the key to making the plugin system fully type-safe.
# It allows a plugin to be defined for a specific subclass of BaseInterpreter,
# such as `Interpreter` or `SyncInterpreter`.
